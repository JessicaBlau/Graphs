This project creates a weighted graph. Within this project there are many different classes that help us make sure this graph is connected, use algorithms on this graph to find the shortest path between two nodes, and classes that draw this graph.

Node - Implemnts the interfacce node_data. This class represents the junctions in these graphs. Meaning the points that the edges come out of and connect to.

Edge - Implemnts the interfacce edge_data. This class represents the vertex that come out of our nodes.

DGraph - Implemnts the interfacce graph. This class represents the graph itselt, it uses the classes edge and node to creat a full graph. 

Graph_Algo - Implemnts the interfacce graph_algorithms. This class has many different algorithms on this grapg that will help us find the shortest path between two node, see if the graph is one or two directional, and see if this graph is connect. 

Graph_GUI - This class uses StdDraw to draw the graph onto the screen.
